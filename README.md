# 🫀 HeartSafe Route AI  
### AI-Powered Emergency Navigation System for Heart Patients (OpenEnv RL Environment)

---

## 🚨 Overview

HeartSafe Route AI is an **OpenEnv-compliant Reinforcement Learning environment** where AI agents learn to make life-saving decisions by selecting the **safest and fastest cardiac emergency routes** under real-world constraints such as:

- 🚦 Traffic conditions  
- 🫁 Air pollution levels  
- 🏥 Hospital capacity & availability  
- ⏱️ Emergency response time  
- ❤️ Patient survival probability  

This system simulates **real-world ambulance routing and smart healthcare logistics**, going beyond traditional shortest-path navigation.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision

In real emergencies, the nearest hospital is not always the safest option.

HeartSafe Route AI models this complexity by forcing AI agents to balance:

- ⏱️ Fastest arrival time  
- 🫁 Lowest pollution exposure  
- 🚦 Traffic-aware routing  
- 🏥 Hospital readiness & capacity  
- ❤️ Patient survival safety score  

👉 The goal is to build a **realistic healthcare decision-making RL benchmark environment**.

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

Traditional routing systems fail in critical medical emergencies because they ignore real-world constraints.

This project introduces AI-driven decision making where:

- A nearby hospital may be full  
- A fast route may pass through polluted zones  
- A low-traffic route may still be medically unsafe  
- AI must optimize survival probability, not just distance  

👉 This makes it a **high-impact reinforcement learning benchmark for healthcare AI systems**.

# 🫀 OpenEnv Compliant RL Environment

An AI-powered emergency navigation system where reinforcement learning agents learn to choose optimal hospital routes under real-world constraints like traffic, pollution, and hospital capacity.

---

## 🧩 OpenEnv Compliance (Core Design)

This environment strictly follows the OpenEnv specification.

---

## 🔁 Required API

```python
reset() -> Observation
step(action) -> Observation, Reward, Done, Info
state() -> CurrentState
```
## 📦 Observation Space

Each observation includes:

{{
  "user_location": [lat, lng],
  "hospitals": [...],
  "traffic_map": [...],
  "pollution_zones": [...],
  "time_elapsed": float,
  "emergency_level": int
}

## 🎮 Action Space

Agent selects:

{
  "selected_route": "fastest | safest | balanced",
  "target_hospital_id": int,
  "routing_priority_weights": {
      "time": float,
      "traffic": float,
      "pollution": float,
      "hospital_capacity": float
  }
}

## 🏥 Core Simulation Features
## 🚑 Realistic Emergency Environment

A simulated AI environment for emergency healthcare routing with dynamic real-world constraints.

### Features
- Live hospital capacity simulation  
- Traffic congestion generator  
- Pollution exposure heatmaps  
- Dynamic route scoring engine  

---

## 🧪 RL Tasks (3 Difficulty Levels)

### 🟢 Task 1 — Emergency Fast Route (Easy)
**Objective:** Reach nearest hospital quickly  
**Constraints:**
- Basic traffic
- Distance optimization  

---

### 🟡 Task 2 — Safe Hospital Selection (Medium)
**Objective:** Avoid overcrowded hospitals  
**Includes:**
- Capacity awareness  
- Traffic conditions  
- Distance balancing  

---

### 🔴 Task 3 — Survival Optimization (Hard)
**Objective:** Maximize patient survival probability  

**Includes:**
- Pollution exposure penalty  
- Traffic delay risk  
- Hospital readiness score  
- Time-critical constraints  

---

## 🧮 Reward Function Design

### Reward Formula
```python
reward =
    (w1 * -travel_time)
  + (w2 * hospital_availability)
  + (w3 * -traffic_delay)
  + (w4 * -pollution_exposure)
  + (w5 * survival_probability)
```
## 🧮 Reward Function Penalties

- High pollution → negative reward  
- Delays → exponential penalty  
- Full hospital → strong penalty  

---

## 🤖 AI Routing Agent

The baseline agent simulates intelligent decision-making:

- Evaluates all hospital options  
- Computes weighted risk score  
- Chooses optimal survival path  
- Learns trade-offs between speed vs safety  

---

## 📊 Grading System (OpenEnv Agent Evaluator)

Each task returns a score:

- **0.0** → Failed mission  
- **0.5** → Partial success  
- **1.0** → Optimal route selected
